# Phase 2 Questions
**Questions**
*1. Why do we use transfer learning/what is transfer learning? What did you need to do in order to turn the Resnet18 architecture into a car classifier.

*2. Why do we need to freeze the weights in the convolutional layer?

*3. Explain how transfer learning is useful in terms of optimization of the cost function.

*4. Does changing the hyperparameters during transfer learning matter? Ie does performance change when we change the optimizer or other settings. Your answer should be backed by data from experiments you have run. There are at least 4 parameters to tune and get results on.
